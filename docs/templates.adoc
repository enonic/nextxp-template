Thus far, page rendering has been based on hard-coding, or editorially composing one page at a time. In this chapter you'll learn how to make page templates - and reuse them across multiple content items.

## Task: Movie details part

To complete this section, we'll need one final part for listing movie details. The content type and content for movies already exists in Enonic, so lets get to work.

. **Add the `movie-details` part to Enonic** - same procedure as before...
+
.src/main/resources/site/parts/movie-details/movie-details.xml
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<part xmlns="urn:enonic:xp:model:1.0">
    <display-name>Movie Details</display-name>
    <description>Show details of a movie</description>
    <form/>
</part>
----
+
.src/main/resources/site/parts/movie-details/movie-details.js
[source,JavaScript]
----
var proxy = require('/lib/nextjs/proxy');

exports.get = proxy.get;
----
+
. **Redeploy** the Enonic app.
+
. **Register the Movie query and view** in Next.
+
.src/components/parts/MovieDetails.tsx
[source,JavaScript]
----
include::{sourcedir}/components/parts/MovieDetails.tsx[]
----
Update the component mappings:
+
.src/components/_mappings.ts
[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
import MovieDetails, {getMovie} from './parts/MovieDetails';

...

ComponentRegistry.addPart(`${APP_NAME}:movie-details`, {
    query: getMovie,
    view: MovieDetails
});

----

== Task: Create template

With the new component registered, let's put it to use.

. In Content Studio, select and **edit your favorite movie** (or choose "No time to die" if you have no faviorites).
+
. Like you did for the other pages, activate the page editor, select the "main" page component and **add the "Movie details" part** to the page.
+
image:movie-details.png[title="No time to die, configured with movie-details part",width=1440px]
+
We now have a single movie nicely presented, but it would be cumbersome to manually configure each movie like this - page templates to the rescue.
+
. In the page editor, **select the page component** (for instance by clicking on the header).
+
image:movie-page.png[title="With page component selected, save as template appears in right hand panel",width=1440px]
+
. Click **Save as template** from the right hand panel.
+
This will create a new page template content item, and open it in a new tab for editing.
+
. **Give your template a better name**, such as "Movie details" and save the changes.
+
image:movie-template.png[title="Content item of type template, configure to support movie items",width=1440px]
+
. Try visiting other movie items to **verify they now automatically render**.

With templates sorted out, let's dive into  <<revalidation#, production mode and page revalidation>>.
