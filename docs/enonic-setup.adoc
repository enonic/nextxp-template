= Setting up Enonic

In this chapter, we will create an Enonic app based on the Headless Movie DB project, and play around with the Headless API

== Enonic at a glance

Our platform is called Enonic XP (XP, or Enonic for short).

=== Enonic apps
Enonic XP allows you to install and run one or more link:https://developer.enonic.com/guides/developer-101/xp7/apps[**applications**] in a single instance.

You can discover ready to run applications on link:https://market.enonic.com/[Enonic Market], or you may build your own, like we will be doing in this tutorial.

Each app may provide specific functionality. It may for instance be everything you need for a large website, or provide specific services, such as an **API**. An app is given a unique <<#new-project, **app name**>> when it's built.

TIP: Useful terminology: A **sandbox** is a local Enonic server running on your laptop. Apps are built from **projects** which are basically a folder that contains the app's source code. Once it is built, it can be **deployed** to the sandbox - where it will be started and made available.

=== Content

Apps typically ship with one or more link:https://developer.enonic.com/guides/developer-101/xp7/content[**content types**]. Content types typically define data structures, JSON style. Each content type gets a unique name which is automatically pre-fixed with the app-name. e.g. `<appName>:<contentTypeName>`.

Content types are used to create **content items**. Content is commonly created and handled via Enonic's link:https://enonic.com/blog/publishing-power-enonic-content-studio-cheat-sheet[**Content Studio**]. Content may be organised in tree structures, which can be useful both for internal, and external purposes - as you will see in this tutorial.

Content items get a unique path **name** - similar to a filename - and a human-friendly displayName.

Content items can exist in two different link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/storage/branches[**branches**]: When creating or editing in Content Studio, you're always working in the `draft` branch. When publishing, new items and changes are copied to the `master` branch.

== The Headless Movie Database

With Enonic, you may obviously create your own content model, but to save time in this tutorial, we'll be using a demo-app known as the link:https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/headless-movie-db[Headless Movie Database] (HMDB) as our starting point.

HMDB ships with a pre-defined content-model and some useful sample content.

== The Guillotine API

Finally, to expose you content, we'll install an app called Guillotine. Once installed, Guillotine automatically exposes a GraphQL API for your applications and content.

Let's get going!

=== Task: Create application from template

. link:https://developer.enonic.com/start[**Install the Enonic CLI**] (follow link for instructions).

. **Create a new project** using the "Headless movie database" as your template:
+
Run the following command from your terminal
+
  enonic project create -r app-hmdb
+
IMPORTANT: Stick with the standard values and keep the suggested project name `com.example.myproject` for the examples in the tutorial to work properly.
This will be referred to as **app name** later in this tutorial.
+
. **Deploy the application** by running this command from your freshly created project folder.
+
  enonic project deploy
+
When asked to create a sandbox (a local instance of Enonic XP), just give it a name i.e. `next-demo` and go with the default values. When the sandbox has started, it outputs some server logs, and the sample content gets imported automatically.

=== Task: Install Content Studio

Navigate to http://localhost:8080 and log in to the admin console (you don't have to create a user for this tutorial).

. Install **Content Studio** (it's an XP app of its own) by completing the _XP Tour_ , or via the `Applications` admin app.
+
. From the _XP_ menu, open `Content Studio`, and choose the `Headless demo` project if needed. You should see something like this:
+

+
NOTE: Some items have a default preview. That's okay for now - as we will customize this preview later.


**Congrats on setting up the Enonic development environment**

With the SDK running, lets have a look at <<api-primer#, the headless API>>.
