= Setting up Next.js
:toc: right
:toclevels: 3
:imagesdir: media/

In this chapter we will create a front-end application that renders pages based on content in the CMS.

== Next.js at a glance

link:https://nextjs.org/[**Next.js**] runs on top of link:https://nodejs.org/en/[Node.js], and provides a shrink-wrapped approach to building sites using the link:https://reactjs.org/[React framework]). Next.js supports both client-side rendering and link:https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/´pages#static-generation-recommended[Server side rendering], as well as pre-generation of static HTML files.

== Task: Create the Next.js project

From an empty folder, run the following command:

[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
npx degit git@github.com:enonic/nextjs-enonic-template.git
----

The "nextjs-enonic-template" is based on link:https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started[Next.js' own introduction app], so if you're familiar with that, you'll recognize the structure of the files.

The template includes some boilerplate we will customize, and some additional code that facilitates and simplifies integration with Enonic - aka **"the Enonic adapter"**.

=== Code overview

The following file structure should now exist within your new project folder:

.Next project files:
[source,files]
----
.evn <!--1-->
src/
    _enonicAdapter/ <!--2-->
    components/ <!--3-->
    pages/
        [[...contentPath]].tsx <!--4-->
        _app.tsx <!--5-->
        _document.tsx <!--6-->
        _component.tsx <!--7-->
        _renderable.tsx
        api/ <!--8-->
            revalidate.ts
            preview.ts
----

<1> Environment variables are placed in this file
<2> Contains integration and rendering logic to work smoothly together with Enonic XP. You should never need to modify these files. Planned to be released as an NPM in the future.
<3> Contains your implementation of CMS components
<4> The fallback next.js router. Enables dynamic rendering based on content in the CMS. File name is not a typo, but Next.js syntax that makes it catch all HTTP requests.
<5> Invoked on every request. Add common structures here (eg. `<head>` etc), but be careful not to remove functionality needed by Content Studio
<6> Vanilla Next.js file that outlines the basic document structure of all pages.
<7> Files supporting the visual page editor in Content Studio
<8> These files support preview mode and regeneration of cached pages


== Task: Configure application

By default, the configuration should work for your setup, but have a look to be sure:

. Verify your configuration
+
The following configuration values should match your environment
+
..env extract:
[source,files]
----
# Provide a unique value which will be used to secure the preview mode
API_TOKEN=mySecretKey

# Enonic app name, must match the name of your app
APP_NAME=com.example.myproject

# Path to site, or site ID
SITE_KEY=/hmdb

# Absolute URL to Content API
CONTENT_API_DRAFT=http://127.0.0.1:8080/site/hmdb/draft
CONTENT_API_MASTER=http://127.0.0.1:8080/site/hmdb/master
----

TIP: The configuration values can be overridden later when deplying your app to a live server.

== Task: Boot the server

Let's fire up Next and see if things are working as planned...

NOTE: Make sure <<enonic-setup#hmdb, Enonic and the Headless Movie Database app is running on localhost:8080>> before you continue

Start Next.js in  **dev mode** by running the following commands from within your next project folder:

    npm install
    npm run dev

If Next boots without errors, point your browser to http://localhost:3000[http://localhost:3000^] to see the glorious result.

[TIP]
====
Running Next in `dev` mode normally works fine. Should you however experience "strange issues" - try deleting the `.next/` folder and reboot

For more details on booting Next, check out the link:https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/cli[Next.js CLI docs].
====

== Next URL patterns

The URL structure of your Next site will mirror the structure of the content in the CMS. http://localhost:3000/[http://localhost:3000/^] is mounted to the site root, which in our case has the internal path `/hmdb`.

Using the Movie Se7en as an example: 

.Result when visiting http://localhost:3000/movies/se7en[http://localhost:3000/movies/se7en^] 
image:se7en-debug.png[title="Default render: movie content item The Godfather",width=766px]

.Se7en as seen in Content Studio - internal path is `/hmdb/movies/se7en`
image:se7en-edit.png[title="Editing item in Content Studio - the path /hmdb/movies/se7en is highlighted",width=768px]

### Task: Visit some more pages

Give the default rendering a spin by trying out some other URLs, for example: +

* http://localhost:3000/movies[http://localhost:3000/movies^] +
* http://localhost:3000/persons[http://localhost:3000/persons^] +
* http://localhost:3000/persons/brad-pitt[http://localhost:3000/persons/brad-pitt^]

...etc.

**That's it for the basic Next.js setup.**

Next, well have a closer look at <<rendering-basics#, how to customize the rendering>>.
